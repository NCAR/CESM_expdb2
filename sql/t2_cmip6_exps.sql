A trend preserving statistical bias correction method is applied to 3-hourly surface meteorological variables from the scenario output to generate a set of ensemble forcing data.  Gridded forcings will be provided by LS3MIP. The land model configuration should be identical to that used in the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations for the parent coupled model.  Spin-up of the land-only simulations should follow the TRENDY protocol.','f16eb5f8-dd9e-11e6-b89b-ac72891c3257','LS3MIP',NULL,'01.00.28',NULL,'LS3MIP','BGC','2100','future ssp5-8.5 land only','land-ssp585','86','no parent','no parent','LAND','2015','none',NULL,NULL),(302,'esm-yr2010CO2-CO2pulse','Upon initialization from end of year 2015 of esm-yr2010CO2-control instantaneously introduce 100 Gt C (\"positive pulse\"; part of the CDR-yr2010-pulse experiment).
